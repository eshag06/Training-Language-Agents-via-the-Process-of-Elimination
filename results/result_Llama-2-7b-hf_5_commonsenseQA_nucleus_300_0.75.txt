The clothes of European ancient peoples, particularly those who inhabited what is now Germany and Belgium, were quite different from the simpler attire worn by those in Southern Europe. Clothes of ancient northern Europe typically had more lace and decoration, and often were colored, even though the material was in its native form, often just a thread or a couple of threads.

While in much of the southern part of Europe, clothing was made from leather or silk, in northern regions, people used wool and hair.
